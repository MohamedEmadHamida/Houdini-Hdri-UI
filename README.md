## 🚀 Usage / Install 

- ![video](images/Install.mp4)


### Option 1: Run Inside Houdini (Direct)

1. Open **Houdini**
2. Open **Python Shell**
3. Paste and run the EXR Browser script
4. Thumbnails load automatically (multi-threaded)
5. Click any thumbnail to apply it as an **Environment Light** in Houdini

If no Environment Light exists, the tool will create one automatically.

---

### Option 2: Install as Houdini Shelf Tool (Recommended)

You can add the EXR Browser as a **Shelf Tool** inside Houdini for quick access.

1. Open **Houdini**
2. Go to **Shelves → New Tool**
3. Set a name, label, and icon (optional)
4. In the **Script** section:
   - Set the language to **Python**
   - Paste the full EXR Browser script code
5. Click **Apply** or **Accept**

You can now launch the EXR Browser directly from the Houdini shelf with one click.

> Tip:  
> For easier updates, you can place the script in a shared tools folder and  
> import it inside the shelf tool instead of pasting the full code.

### Option 3: Run Without Houdini (Standalone)

You can also use the EXR Browser as a **standalone desktop application**
without Houdini installed.

1. Make sure Python and all dependencies are installed:
   - PySide6
   - OpenImageIO
   - NumPy
2. Set the following flag at the top of the script:
   
   ```python
   ENABLE_HOUDINI = 0
